OpenGrok Foundation is an all volunteer non-profit organization that aims to promote research and development of free and public technologies that advance human understanding of complex software systems.

    <h2>
Helping the world understand software.
</h2>
        <p>Modern computing software and systems can be made up of hundreds of millions of lines of source code. They can be written collaboratively by thousands of people and over many years. Trying to understand how it all works can be a daunting challenge even for the most experienced software professionals. Members of the OpenGrok Foundation have contributed to the development, publication and support of technologies such as OpenGrok source search engine which is used for making large open source software code repositories publicly available.
        </p>
    <h2>
    Making open source software truly open.
    </h2>
        <p>
        Since the advent of open source software movement, there is a large body of software available to public freely and openly. Effective utilization of open source software requires free and open tools that enable people to easily understand, inspect, admire and contribute back to the open source software.
        </p>
    <h2>Supporting a community of innovators.</h2>
        <p>
        Since its inception in 2005, OpenGrok project has resulted in a large community of volunteer developers and users who are constantly adding improvements and new innovative ideas. OpenGrok Foundation was formed in 2018 and is led by major contributors to the OpenGrok project over the years, with the goal of fostering an active community, improving awareness, enabling outreach and sustaining the community momentum with strategic and logistical support.
